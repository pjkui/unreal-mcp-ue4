# unreal-mcp-ue4
> UE4.27.2-focused MCP server for Unreal Engine using Unreal Python Remote Execution

`unreal-mcp-ue4` started from the core idea and early workflow shape of [runreal/unreal-mcp](https://github.com/runreal/unreal-mcp), but it has since been heavily refactored for Unreal Engine 4.27.2 and expanded with many new tools, UE4-specific compatibility layers, documentation, and smoke coverage. At this point, the original inspiration remains, but the public surface and day-to-day behavior are substantially different and UE4-first.

This port and the follow-up tool, documentation, and smoke-test work were developed with assistance from OpenAI Codex.

> This project is still under active development, so bugs, rough edges, and UE4.27-specific limitations may still surface.

## Overview

- No custom Unreal C++ plugin from this repository is required.
- The server talks to the editor through Unreal's built-in Python Remote Execution path.
- The tool surface is organized into granular tools and higher-level tool namespaces.
- UE5-only editor scripting features are not reintroduced; UE4.27-safe operations work normally, while unreliable graph or binding flows are either excluded from the MCP surface or return a clear message instead of silently failing.

## Origin

- Original inspiration and starting point: [runreal/unreal-mcp](https://github.com/runreal/unreal-mcp)
- The current codebase has gone through extensive UE4.27-focused refactoring, architecture changes, and tool expansion.
- In practice, the shared idea is still visible, but the implementation, scope, and supported workflows now reflect a separate UE4-first project.
- Unreal Python API reference: [Unreal Engine Python API 4.27](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/python-api/?application_version=4.27)

## Safety

- This is not an official Epic Games project.
- Any connected MCP client can inspect and modify your open Unreal Editor session.
- Use a disposable test project first, especially when trying asset or world-generation tools.

## Requirements

- Unreal Engine `4.27.2`
- Node.js `18+`
- `npm`
- An MCP client such as Codex, Claude Desktop, Cursor, or GitHub Copilot in a supported IDE

## Required Unreal Editor Setup

This repository does not ship its own Unreal plugin. Instead, it depends on built-in editor features that must be enabled in your UE4.27.2 project.

### Required plugins

- `Python Editor Script Plugin`
- `Editor Scripting Utilities`

### Required project setting

- `Edit -> Project Settings -> Python -> Enable Remote Execution`

### Notes

- UMG tooling works with editor modules that already ship with Unreal Editor. There is no extra UMG plugin from this repository to install.
- Keep the target Unreal project open while using the MCP server or running tests.
- If you change plugin or Python settings, restart the editor before testing again.

## Installation

### 1. Clone and build the server

```bash
git clone https://github.com/conaman/unreal-mcp-ue4.git
cd unreal-mcp-ue4
npm install
npm run build
```

Successful build output should create `dist/bin.js`, `dist/index.js`, and `dist/editor/tools.js`.

### 1a. Install from npm

Once the package is published on npm, you can install it directly instead of cloning the repository.

Global install:

```bash
npm install -g unreal-mcp-ue4
```

One-off invocation with `npx`:

```bash
npx unreal-mcp-ue4
```

If you install from npm, the MCP server entry point is the published `unreal-mcp-ue4` binary instead of a local `dist/bin.js` path.

### 2. Enable the Unreal requirements

In Unreal Editor:

1. Open the target UE4.27.2 project.
2. Go to `Edit -> Plugins`.
3. Enable `Python Editor Script Plugin`.
4. Enable `Editor Scripting Utilities`.
5. Restart the editor if prompted.
6. Go to `Edit -> Project Settings -> Python`.
7. Enable `Enable Remote Execution`.
8. Restart the editor again if needed.

### 3. Configure your MCP client

Most clients use a local `stdio` server command. The safest configuration is to point to an absolute `node` path and an absolute `dist/bin.js` path.

Generic MCP client example:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "unreal-ue4": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/node",
      "args": [
        "/absolute/path/to/unreal-mcp-ue4/dist/bin.js"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

If `node` is already on your `PATH`, you can use `"command": "node"` instead.

### Codex example

```bash
codex mcp add unreal-ue4 -- /absolute/path/to/node /absolute/path/to/unreal-mcp-ue4/dist/bin.js
```

If you installed the package globally from npm, you can point the client directly at the published executable:

```bash
codex mcp add unreal-ue4 -- unreal-mcp-ue4
```

### GitHub Copilot example

For VS Code, create `.vscode/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "unreal-ue4": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "C:\\Users\\YourName\\dev\\unreal-mcp-ue4\\dist\\bin.js"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Then start the server from the MCP config UI and verify that `unreal-ue4` appears in the tools picker.

Official Copilot docs:

- [About Model Context Protocol in GitHub Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/context/mcp)

## Usage

### Interface model

- Prefer the `manage_*` namespace tools as the main MCP surface.
- Treat `manage_editor.project_info` as the canonical project summary entry point.
- Treat `manage_editor.map_info` and `manage_level.world_outliner` as the canonical map and level read entry points.
- Use direct tools only for a small set of low-level primitives such as Unreal session path discovery and actor create or update or delete flows.
- Use `manage_editor.run_python` as an escape hatch for debugging, rapid prototyping, and UE4.27 API gaps that are not yet wrapped as stable tools.

### Recommended first-run flow

1. Open your UE4.27.2 project and wait for the editor to finish loading.
2. Make sure the required plugins and `Enable Remote Execution` are enabled.
3. Build the MCP server with `npm run build`.
4. Start your MCP client or open a new session in the client that already references this server.
5. Run a small read-only command first.

Useful first commands:

- `manage_editor` with `action: "project_info"`
- `manage_editor` with `action: "map_info"`
- `manage_level` with `action: "world_outliner"`
- `manage_tools` with `action: "list_namespaces"`

Useful first natural-language requests:

- `Get project info from the unreal-ue4 server.`
- `List the actors in the current level.`
- `Spawn a StaticMeshActor named TestCube at 0,0,100.`

### What the server can do

- Read project, map, asset, and actor information from the open editor.
- Spawn, inspect, move, and delete actors in the current level.
- Search assets and inspect references or metadata.
- Create common UE4 data assets such as `DataAsset` and `StringTable` assets.
- Create and edit Blueprint assets where UE4.27 Python exposes the necessary editor APIs.
- Create and edit Widget Blueprint trees with UE4.27-safe UMG helpers.
- Run grouped tool namespaces that dispatch through `action` and `params`.

## Testing

### Quick smoke test

The smoke test builds the server, launches its own local MCP server process, connects to the already running Unreal Editor, and runs a deterministic validation flow. You do not need to start a separate MCP server manually before this test.

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

This checks:

- MCP server startup
- tool discovery
- project info, map info, and world outliner reads
- source-control provider and state reads
- direct-tool actor create, update, and delete
- namespace-layer actor spawn, search, transform, inspect, and delete
- tool-namespace discovery and namespace-layer dispatch for source control and actor control

### Asset-inclusive smoke test

```bash
npm run test:e2e -- --with-assets
```

This adds:

- Blueprint creation
- Blueprint component editing
- Blueprint mesh assignment
- Blueprint compilation
- DataAsset creation
- DataAsset metadata readback
- StringTable creation
- Texture import and metadata readback
- Widget Blueprint creation
- TextBlock and Button insertion
- advanced CanvasPanel and child-widget add, move, and remove flows
- cleanup of temporary assets under `/Game/MCP/Tests`

Useful options:

- `npm run test:e2e -- --with-assets --keep-assets` keeps the generated test assets so you can inspect them in the Content Browser after the run.
- `npm run test:e2e -- --skip-namespace` skips the namespace-dispatch portion of the smoke run.
- `npm run test:e2e -- --verbose` prints MCP server stderr during the run.
- `npm run test:e2e -- --help` prints the runner options without rebuilding the server.

### Windows test commands

Open PowerShell in the repository folder:

```powershell
cd C:\dev\unreal-mcp-ue4
npm install
npm run test:e2e
npm run test:e2e -- --with-assets
```

### What success looks like

- The console prints `[PASS]` for every test step.
- Actor tests visibly create and then remove temporary actors in the editor through both the direct-tool and namespace surfaces.
- The asset-inclusive test creates temporary Blueprint, DataAsset, StringTable, Texture, and Widget Blueprint assets under `/Game/MCP/Tests` and then removes them before exit unless `--keep-assets` is used.

### Recommended test workflow

1. Start with `npm run test:e2e`.
2. If that passes, run `npm run test:e2e -- --with-assets`.
3. After both pass, try the server once from your real MCP client.
4. Use a separate Unreal test project before pointing the server at production content.

## Publishing to npm

The package is prepared for npm publishing as a public package.

The project version format is unified everywhere as the semver-compatible date form `YYYY.M.D-N`. For example, the current release is published consistently as `2026.4.1-1`.

Recommended maintainer flow:

1. Update the project version.
2. Run the publish preflight:

```bash
npm run publish:check
```

3. If you have a running UE4.27 editor test environment available, also run:

```bash
npm run test:e2e -- --with-assets --skip-build
```

4. Publish:

```bash
npm publish
```

Notes:

- `prepack` runs `npm run build`, so the published tarball always uses a fresh `dist`.
- `npm run publish:check` verifies typecheck, rebuilds the package, and runs `npm pack --dry-run` so you can inspect the exact tarball contents before publishing.
- The package name `unreal-mcp-ue4` is currently available on npm.
- Because the unified date version uses a semver prerelease suffix, publish with an explicit dist-tag such as `npm publish --tag latest`.

## Troubleshooting

### `Remote node is not available`

- Make sure Unreal Editor is fully open before running the MCP client or smoke test.
- Verify that `Python Editor Script Plugin` is enabled.
- Verify that `Editor Scripting Utilities` is enabled.
- Verify that `Enable Remote Execution` is enabled in project settings.
- Restart Unreal Editor after changing any of the above.

### Connection or discovery problems on Windows

- Allow `UnrealEditor.exe` and `node.exe` through Windows Defender Firewall.
- The bundled `unreal-remote-execution` package uses UDP multicast discovery on `239.0.0.1:6766` and a localhost command channel on `127.0.0.1:6776`.
- If your client config uses JSON, escape backslashes or switch to forward slashes.

### Client starts but cannot find `node`

- Use an absolute path to `node` or `node.exe` in the MCP config instead of relying on `PATH`.

### Some Blueprint graph or UMG binding commands are unavailable

- Widget Blueprint creation and common widget-tree editing work in this fork; the main UMG gaps are delegate binding helpers and runtime-dependent viewport flows.
- Blueprint asset creation, component editing, compilation, and high-level asset summaries work; graph inspection, graph pin wiring, and variable or function metadata helpers are intentionally excluded because stock UE4.27 Python does not expose the required Blueprint metadata reliably.
- Capability areas that are not reliable enough to keep in the MCP surface are listed under `Excluded Capability Areas` in the tool section.

## Notes and Limitations

- World-building and structure-generation tools use UE4.27-friendly preset builders based on engine basic-shape assets.
- Common UMG widget-tree editing works well with CanvasPanel-based layouts, but delegate binding helpers remain unavailable in stock UE4.27 Python.
- UMG positioning currently targets `CanvasPanel` slots in UE4.27.
- Reparenting the current root widget and editing named-slot content are not currently handled.
- Blueprint asset and component editing work, but Blueprint graph inspection, pin wiring, and variable or function metadata inspection are excluded in the stock UE4.27 Python environment.
- The tool surface includes both granular tools and action-based tool namespaces so different MCP clients can work at different abstraction levels.

The tool list below is generated from `server/index.ts` during build.

## Available Tools

Notes call out important requirements or UE4.27 limitations when they matter. Empty notes mean there are no additional caveats beyond normal editor setup.

The recommended public surface is the `manage_*` namespace layer. Prefer `manage_editor.project_info`, `manage_editor.map_info`, and `manage_level.world_outliner` as canonical read entry points, and treat the small direct-tool set as low-level primitives for path discovery and actor CRUD.

### Excluded Capability Areas

These capability areas are intentionally not exposed through the MCP surface in this UE4.27 port because they fail reliably in the current Python environment and only add prompt or context overhead until a native bridge exists.

| Capability Area | Effect on MCP Surface | Why It Is Excluded |
|-----------------|-----------------------|---------------------|
| Blueprint event-graph event insertion | Related event-node and input-action helpers are excluded from the MCP surface. | The current UE4.27 Python environment does not expose reliable event graph access or K2 event reference setup. |
| Blueprint graph inspection and node search | Graph-analysis, graph-inspection, and node-search helpers are excluded from the MCP surface. | The current UE4.27 Python environment does not expose Blueprint graph arrays such as UbergraphPages or FunctionGraphs reliably enough for deterministic inspection. |
| Low-level Blueprint graph node creation | Generic graph-node helpers and related self or component reference insertion helpers are excluded from the MCP surface. | The current UE4.27 Python environment does not expose stable low-level graph node creation or member-reference wiring. |
| Blueprint function-call node authoring | Function-node helpers that depend on editor graph member-reference setup are excluded from the MCP surface. | The current UE4.27 Python environment does not expose reliable function-call node reference setup. |
| Blueprint variable and function metadata inspection | Variable-detail and function-detail helpers are excluded from the MCP surface. | The current UE4.27 Python environment does not expose NewVariables or FunctionGraphs reliably enough for deterministic inspection. |
| Blueprint variable authoring | Variable-creation helpers are excluded from the MCP surface. | BPVariableDescription and EdGraphPinType are not exposed in the current UE4.27 Python environment. |
| UMG delegate-binding authoring | Widget event-binding and text-binding helpers are excluded from the MCP surface. | DelegateEditorBinding is not exposed in the current UE4.27 Python environment. |
